#Manual for Anthroponic System

##Weekly Maintainance
Measure pH of the nutrient solution in the tank.
The pH should have a value of 6 or lower.
If not, adjust the pH with the pH Downer.
Atenttion: The pH Donwer has to be handled with care.
It is highly corrosive and dangerous when having skin contact!
Also, pay attention to not put in too much in one time.
Slightly ajust the pH by pouring in a little bit,
measure again later, and adjust further if necessary.
Be aware that a out of range pH can cause the plants to die within minutes.

##Dosage of Fresh Urine
Measure the EC (ppm) value of the water with the EC probe.
The EC shall not exceed a value of 1.8, but can be as low as 1.0.
The EC describes how many nutrients there are in the water,
so keeping it high ensures faster growth of the plants.
A too high EC tough can burn the roots and kill the plant within minutes.

##Regular Check
Daily check the plantation. Make sure it is functioning checking,
if the flooding cycle is working. The plant shall never show any sing of wilting!
Wilting is a clear sign, that something is wrong with the system.
Also make sure, that there is enough of nutrient solution in the storage tank,
fill up with water if necessary.

##Plant Care
Hydroponics Systems are well know to accelarate plant growth.
Make sure to check your plants regularly, see if the need to be cut,
harvested, or threated against pests.

##Pest Control
A simple method for pest cotnrol is to use an exctract of tabacco.
Use a small amount of tabacco, put it into water, let it sit for at least
an hour, the spray it on the plants immediately, as it turns bad very
fast. Try to avoid spraying on the roots, respectivaly the clay, and the storage tank,
aso the exctract can be damaging to the microbial activity within, as well 
as for the roots.
