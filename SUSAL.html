<p>Reorientation of SUSAL</p>

<p>(Giving up straight commercial nature of the project, for the sake of idealism.)</p>

<p>The PeePonicPrototype</p>

<p>Concept:
The PeePonicSystem does not smell bad, it's hygenic and therefor safe to handle, and creates premium quality vegtables.</p>

<p>It takes in fresh urine and nitrifyes it in a biofilter. For this purpose it is equiped with an airpump, as well the water is oxygenized
when flowing back after flooding trough maximization of dripping.</p>

<p>Stages:
Summer 2016
Prototypes ZÃ¼rich and Trasadingen. Possibly a prototype system in Andalusia, Spain as well, depending on the development of the settlement project.</p>

<p>The goal for the FF Prototype is, to acquire the container at Flurstrasse as its base.
A modification of the roof allows to store clay in softpots directly on top of it. The roof probably has to be reinforced, as it has to carry
the weight of the water, and the clay filled softpots.</p>

<p>It is a possibilty to plan the container properly and let it get manufactered in spain bei star container.</p>

<p>Components:
    -IBC 1000L (120x100x80)
    -Waterpump</p>

<p>Calculations: 0.3<em>6</em>2.4</p>
