# SUSAL
Sustainable Alimentation

Open Source System to susatinably grow high quality food by using human waste as nutrition,
in a hygienic and odorless, electronically controlled process.

#Concept
Trough semless integration in the cycles of the nature, SUSAL redefines sustainability
of foodproduction. This paradigm shift allows food to be produced, using only a fraction
of the energy compared to actual methods.

#The System
The SUSAL system provides fresh vegetables and uses human urine as nutrient.
Thus taking, something everybody wants to get rid off, converting it to something
everybody needs to survive.
